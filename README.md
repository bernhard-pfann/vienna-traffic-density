Status: Done<br>

## <b>Description</b>
In this project I attempt to model the traffic-density for the City of Vienna solely based on publicly available data.<br>

### Data Sources
- <b>Road network:</b> The official road network from (https://www.data.gv.at/) consists of information on ~30000 street segments and its respective geolocation and street-type.
- <b>Uber rides:</b> Information on Uber rides per City can be accessed at (https://movement.uber.com/). Uber is splitting the City of Vienna into 1370 subdistricts where travel-time between these starting & ending-areas is reported. Additional categorical information about weekdays or time of the day are available.

### Approach
<ul>
    <li><b>Simulating Paths</b></li>
<ul>
    <li>Initialize a network graph consisting of all recorded streets of the City of Vienna</li>
    <li>Map maximum speed-limit to each network edge dependent on its street-type</li>
    <li>Calculate the shortest path of streets between pairs of start/end-nodes in the network</li>
    <li>Collect shortest path information for every start/end combination observed in the set of Uber rides</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Constrained Optimization</b></li>
<ul>
    <li>Frame a constrained optimiziation problem to estimate a "traffic-coefficient" per each area, representing its traffic-density</li>
    <li>Analyze traffic-density per area during different times of the day</li>
</ul>
<br>
</ul>

## <b>Repository Structure</b>

 - `artifacts/` collection of .pkl and .csv files that are generated by execution of `run.py`
 - `notebooks/` analysis of simulated paths and optimized coefficients
 - `src/` core package to simulate calculate shortest paths
 - `config.py` configurable parameters like source paths
 - `run.py` executation file
